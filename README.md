# Monster-Attack-Game
This project is an assignment for computer science course taken at UCSD. I created a simple game simulation involving different monster characters. I programmed for classes that implement different interfaces to form the varied array of monster characters. The fight mechanisms were coded in a separate class. The project explores class hierarchies.
